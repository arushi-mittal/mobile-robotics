    "# Introduction to types of Transformations and Homogeneous coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "In robotics applications, it is inevitable to keep track of the frames of multiple objects/worlds. These frames can be transformations from one coordinate frame to the other. **Homogeneous coordinates** help in keeping track of various coordinate frames and allow performing composition of various transforms. We will first try to understand between types of transformations and their invariant properties.\n",
    "1. What is the difference between Affine, Similarity, and Euclidean transform? What are the invariant properities of each type of transform?\n",
    "2. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEl63t-opM) to briefly understand homogeneous coordinates. What are points at infinity? What type of transformation can you apply to transform a point from infinity to a point that is not at infinity? \n",
    "3. Using homogeneous coordinates we can represent different types of transformation as point transforms vs. frame transforms. Concatenation of transforms (whether you post multiply transformation matrices or pre-multiply transformation matrices) depends on the problem and how you are viewing it. Try to understand the difference between frame vs. point transformations from this [video](https://youtu.be/Za7Sdegf8m8?t=1834). Let's assume that our camera and world frames are coinciding with each other. We need to estimate the camera to world **frame** transformation matrix after applying the transformations defined below in terms of $T_i$.We apply **frame** transform to move the camera in the world in the following order:\n",
    "    1. $T_1$ from the camera coordinate frame.\n",
    "    2. $T_2$ from the world coordinate frame.\n",
    "    3. $T_3$ from the world coordinate frame.\n",
    "    4. $T_4$ from the camera coordinate frame.\n",
    "    5. $T_5$ from the camera coordinate frame.\n"

    "1. Similarity and Euclidean transformations are special cases of affine transformations. An affine transformation is a combination of a non-singular linear transformation and translation, whereas similarity transformation is a combination of translation, rotation, uniform scaling , and reflection. A Euclidean transformation is a case of affine transformation where the linear transformation is rotation ($A \\space A^{T} = A^{T}A = I$). The geometry of Euclidean symmetry is carried forward. The invariants for affine transformations are points, straight lines, planes, parallelism, ratios of lengths along parallel sides. The invariants for Euclidean transformations are lengths, angles and all the preserved properties of affine transformations. For similarity transformations, the angles, shape and trace of the matrix is invariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Points at infinity are points that are infinitively far away with finite coordinates. In the transformation from Euclidean to Homogenous coordinates, the third coordinate of the vector is made 0, so that when we are going back to Euclidean representation, we divide by 0 and the points are infinitely far. The direction to the point is still maintained, so even if the point is infinitively far away, we can still estimate the direction to that point. This property is useful while working with cameras and infinitely far points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Since the transformation from camera frame is post-multiplied and transformation from world frame is pre-multiplied, the transformations are as follows:\n",
