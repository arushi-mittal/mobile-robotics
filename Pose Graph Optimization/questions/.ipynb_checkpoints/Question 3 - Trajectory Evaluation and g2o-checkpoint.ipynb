This is useful to test the global consistency of a trajectory, which is done by comparing the absolute distances between estimated and ground truth trajectory. As both trajectories can be specified in arbitrary coordinate frames, they first need to be aligned. This can be achieved by using the Horn method, which finds the rigid-body transformation S.\n",
